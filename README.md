# lineExtractor

## What is lineExtractor?
Line extractor is a small and efficient program that takes a section of lines of one file and saves them to
another file. This is useful if you have for example a GB sized log file that is too large to open in a text editor.
With this program, you can extract a portion of the lines and save them to another, smaller file to be able
to read them.
